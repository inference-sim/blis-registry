"""Entry-level rewriting of a committed coefficient set, byte-preserving elsewhere.

The sets are hand-ordered YAML with comments, so a writer that owns a few entries must
replace exactly those and pass every other byte through. An entry is identified by its
NAME and its SCOPE, because one name legitimately appears once per part (and, for a
model-scoped entry, once per model). Scopes are compared parsed, so a reordered or
re-spaced scope is still the same entry rather than a reason to insert a duplicate.
