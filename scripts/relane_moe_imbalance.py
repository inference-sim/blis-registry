"""Relane the MoE routing-imbalance coefficients onto the vLLM expert kernels.

WHY. `moe_routing_imbalance_median` multiplies the routed-expert FLOPs in
blis-latency-kernel (`kernel.go:403`), charging for the fact that a grouped GEMM is gated
by its slowest expert when routing is uneven. The committed values were fitted on
AISimulate's TRT-LLM MoE sweeps, whose `kernel_source` is one of three
`moe_torch_flow*` paths. vLLM does not run those: it runs Triton, FlashInfer-Cutlass or
Marlin expert kernels, seven distinct ones in the sweep, and they tolerate skew
differently. On h200 the dominant TRT-LLM kernel shows a 1.066 median penalty where every
vLLM kernel sits between 0.989 and 1.058.

THE ESTIMATOR IS THE COMMITTED ONE and is dispatch-correct by construction: it pairs a
skewed measurement against the BALANCED measurement of the same shape AND the same
`kernel_source`, so a ratio never crosses kernels. `fit_gemm_envelope.report_moe` is the
reference; this script reproduces that pairing and writes the result.

WHICH SKEW. The committed median comes from `power_law_1.01`, the milder of the two skews
the sweep carries. That choice is kept: `power_law_1.2` is a harder distribution than a
production router with auxiliary-loss balancing produces, and switching the basis would
change what the coefficient means rather than where it was measured.

A100 IS NOT RELANED. Its vLLM MoE sweep has no shape measured under both a skewed and the
balanced distribution, so no ratio is derivable; it keeps its SGLang borrow, which is the
only lane carrying that family for the part.
